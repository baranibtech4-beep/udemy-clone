## Detailed Description

This Udemy Clone is a front-end web project that replicates the design and layout of the Udemy homepage using HTML5 and CSS3. The main objective of this project was to practice building real-world website layouts and improve my understanding of modern CSS styling techniques.

The project focuses on structuring content properly using semantic HTML and designing visually appealing sections using CSS. Flexbox is used extensively to align elements such as the navigation bar, course cards, and content sections.

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar includes:
- Udemy logo/title
- Search input box with icon
- Navigation links
- Hover effects for better user interaction

It is designed to look clean and structured similar to the original Udemy website.

### Hero / Banner Section
The homepage includes a banner or featured section to attract users' attention. This section helps in understanding image positioning and layout styling.

### Course Cards Section
The course section displays multiple course cards arranged using Flexbox. Each card includes:
- Course image
- Course title
- Instructor name
- Price
- Star rating

This section helped me understand spacing, alignment, margins, padding, and responsive layout behavior.

### Styling and Effects
The project includes:
- Hover effects on buttons and cards
- Proper font styling using Google Fonts
- Icons using Font Awesome
- Clean color combinations
- Spacing and layout consistency

### Project Goal
The main goal of this project was:
- To improve my frontend development skills
- To understand how real-world websites are structured
- To practice layout alignment using Flexbox
- To gain experience in publishing projects using GitHub Pages

This project is purely built using HTML and CSS without JavaScript. It is a beginner-friendly project aimed at strengthening core web development fundamentals.
